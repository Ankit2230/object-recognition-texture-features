The texture-based recognition procedures can be connected just when a picture
has textural properties. The outcomes rely on a considerable measure of
components like layout estimate, pixel moves, framework setup, spatial
circulation of pixels and the intricacy of info picture. GLCM gives unmistakable
outcomes when contrasted with some other such strategy however takes
additional time. It additionally builds the arrangement precision. Surface
examination has been utilized in an assortment of uses, for example, remote
detecting, medicinal picture handling, archive preparing, and characterization
of land utilize classifications. The system portrayed in this task can assume
crucial job in these zones.

FUTURE WORK
The given work provides object detection using the Random Forest Classifier
which provides accuracy around 94-97%. We can include more sets of images
in the dataset like that of a person, animal, car, etc. This model also forms the
basis for facial expressions recognition, neural networks and can be extended to
achieve that. Also, no particular model is always accurate for all kinds of data.
So many other machine learning algorithms linear regression, Nearest Neighbor
Classifier, etc. and deep learning algorithms can be applied to obtain better
accuracy on other datasets but the basic model of training and predicting used
here remains the same. Thus, this model can be extended to perform many tasks
in the future
